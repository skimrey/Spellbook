Custom build, you'll probably just want to take the keymap. It is 5 rows, 20 columns using one PCB hopped to another rather than a true split configuration. It uses a teensy 2.0 ++ so you could do a handwire using the pins in config along with one of those.  Otherwise, if you want to use all the files just remember to edit rules to match your microprocessor as well as config for your new pins.
